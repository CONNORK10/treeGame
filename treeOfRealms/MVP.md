## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Specification

**Project Name:** Tree Level Adventure  

**Objective:**  
Create a simple browser-based 2D platformer game where players control a character that progresses through multiple levels by defeating minions.

---

**Core Features:**  

1. **Player Movement:**  
   - Players can move left, right, and jump using keyboard controls (A, D, SPACE).  
   - Players are constrained within the game world boundaries.  

2. **Minions (Enemies):**  
   - Each level spawns a random number of minions (5-15).  
   - Minions are stationary obstacles with physics applied to interact with the player.  

3. **Combat:**  
   - Players can "attack" minions by clicking the mouse.  
   - Minions within a set radius (50 pixels) are destroyed on attack.  

4. **Level Progression:**  
   - Levels are completed when all minions are defeated.  
   - A new level starts automatically after a short delay, with the difficulty scaling (more minions).  
   - Game ends after completing five levels with a congratulatory message.  

5. **Physics and Game Environment:**  
   - Gravity affects the player and minions, keeping them grounded.  
   - Collision detection ensures interaction between the player, level bounds, and minions.  

6. **User Interface:**  
   - Game area displays within a styled container on the browser.  
   - Game aesthetics include a simple and clean style for the player, minions, and environment.

---

**Victory Condition:**  
Players defeat all minions in five progressively harder levels.

**Failure Condition:**  
None explicitly defined for MVP (players cannot lose).

### Additional Considerations for MVP:  
- Game runs on all modern browsers with no external dependencies apart from Phaser.  
- All assets are basic shapes created programmaticallyâ€”no external images required.
